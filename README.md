# üìò Polymarket Pro - Complete Website Guide

## üéØ What is Polymarket Pro?

**Polymarket Pro** is a **decentralized prediction market platform** built on blockchain technology that allows users to bet on the outcome of real-world events. Think of it as a stock market for predictions - where instead of trading company stocks, you're trading your beliefs about future events.

### The Core Concept

Prediction markets work on a simple principle: **Collective wisdom is often more accurate than individual experts**. When people put their money where their mouth is, the market naturally finds the most likely outcome.

**Example:**
- Question: "Will Bitcoin reach $100,000 by December 2025?"
- You can bet **YES** (if you think it will happen) or **NO** (if you think it won't)
- The percentage of people betting YES vs NO gives us the market's probability
- When the event resolves, winners get paid and losers lose their stake

## üåü Why Does This Website Exist?

### The Problem It Solves

1. **Information Discovery** - Traditional polls and surveys can be biased or manipulated. When people risk real money, they're more honest about their true beliefs.

2. **Financial Opportunity** - If you have knowledge or insight about future events (crypto, sports, politics, etc.), you can profit from your expertise.

3. **Risk Management** - Businesses and individuals can hedge against uncertain outcomes by taking positions in prediction markets.

4. **Entertainment & Engagement** - Makes following real-world events more exciting and engaging.

## üí° Understanding Prediction Markets

### How Odds Work

Market odds are determined by the ratio of YES to NO bets:

**Example:**
- Total YES bets: 70,000 POLY
- Total NO bets: 30,000 POLY
- Total pool: 100,000 POLY
- YES probability: 70%
- NO probability: 30%

### Calculating Payouts

**If you bet YES and win:**
```
Your Payout = Your Stake + (Your Stake / Total YES) √ó Total NO Pool
```

**Example:**
- You bet: 1,000 POLY on YES
- Total YES: 70,000 POLY
- Total NO: 30,000 POLY
- Market resolves: YES wins
- Your winnings: 1,000 + (1,000 / 70,000) √ó 30,000 = 1,428.57 POLY
- Your profit: 428.57 POLY (42.8% return)
